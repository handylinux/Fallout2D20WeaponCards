.44 Pistol,Small Guns,6,Vicious,Physical,1,Close Quarters,4,99,C,2,,.44 Magnum,"The .44 pistol is a double-action revolver, chambered to use the .44 Magnum cartridge. It's a powerful gun, though not as customizable as other handguns. Due to their simple, rugged design, they're prized by their owners, but not so uncommon as to be truly rare."
10mm Pistol,Small Guns,4,,Physical,2,"Close Quarters, Reliable",4,50,C,1,,10mm,"Small, dependable, reasonably powerful, and available, the 10mm pistol has been a staple widely the bombs first fell. Its wasteland combat since of customization mean and potential for that a versatility will keep its owner well-looked-after 10mm pistol safe for a long time."
Flare Gun,Small Guns,3,,Physical,0,Reliable,2,50,M,1,,Flare,"A Flare gun is a break-action single-shot device not really designed to inflict damage. Rather, it shoots signal flares which are used by many factions to signal for assistance by firing them high into the air."
Assault Rifle,Small Guns,5,Burst,Physical,2,Two-Handed,13,144,M,2,,5.56mm Rifle,"This gas-operated rifle is a common sight across the wasteland, and well-liked because of the low recoil and reasonable accuracy, and the ease of modifications. Most versions found are only capable of semi-automatic fire, but the weapon is easily modified for automatic fire."
Combat Rifle,Small Guns,5,,Physical,2,Two-Handed,11,117,M,2,,.45,"A pre-War weapon found across the wastelands and used in large numbers by various aggressive factions. Combat Rifles are a rugged and adaptable design, able to be modified to fill a variety of different battlefield roles."
Gauss Rifle,Small Guns,10,Piercing 1,Physical,1,Two-Handed,16,228,L,5,,2mm EC,"The gauss rifle uses magnetic induction to propel a projectile at incredible, devastating speeds. Each shot can be ""charged‚Äù for maximum damage by holding the trigger for a moment before releasing to fire."
Hunting Rifle,Small Guns,6,Piercing 1,Physical,0,Two-Handed,10,55,M,2,,.308,"A bolt-action rifle commonly found in the hands of super mutants and raiders. The simple design made them common amongst hunters and survivalists before the Great War, and they're endlessly customizable. It seems fanciful to suggest that the simple short-barrelled slug-thrower carried by a super mutant could be turned into a precision sniper's rifle, yet that describes the hunting rifle perfectly."
Submachine Gun,Small Guns,3,Burst,Physical,3,"Inaccurate, Two-Handed",12,109,C,1,,.45,"These submachine guns were an old design, even before the War, and while they're hideously inaccurate, their rate-of-fire means you don't need to be accurate."
Combat Shotgun,Small Guns,5,Spread,Physical,2,"Inaccurate, Two-Handed",11,87,C,2,,Shotgun Shells,"Combat shotguns are shotguns intended for an offensive role, typically by a military force; they're ideal for close-range fighting in tunnels, within buildings, or through the ruined streets of old cities."
Double-Barrel Shotgun,Small Guns,5,"Spread, Vicious",Physical,0,"Inaccurate, Two-Handed",9,39,C,1,,Shotgun Shells,"Before the Great War, double-barrel shotguns were mainly used for hunting and home defense, and this has changed little. They are break-action and come in an either a side-by-side or over-and-under barrel configuration. Simple to make and maintain, these shotguns are seen frequently in the Commonwealth and the rest of the wasteland."
Pipe Bolt-Action,Small Guns,5,Piercing 1,Physical,0,Unreliable,3,30,C,0,,.308,"A makeshift weapon, usually seen in the hands of those who can't make, buy or scavenge anything better, pip guns are crude and somewhat unreliable, but effective enough. Bolt-action pipe guns tend to be chambered for rifle caliber rounds, trading rate-of-fire for power and simplicity "
Pipe Gun,Small Guns,3,,Physical,2,"Close Quarters, Unreliable",2,30,C,0,,.38,"A crude, homemade weapon, normally seen in the hands of those who can't make, buy or scavenge anything better, pipe guns are crude and somewhat unreliable, but effective enough. The most common form of pipe gun is a simple little semi-auto hand gun, chambered for the common 38 round, but enterprising (or desperate) souls have been known to modify these guns for automatic fire or precision sniping"
Pipe Revolver,Small Guns,4,,Physical,1,"Close Quarters, Unreliable",4,25,C,0,,.45,"Like the other forms of pipe gun, the pipe revolver is a makeshift or homemade gun, in this case modelled after a revolver. It strikes a balance between the stopping power of the pipe bolt-action, and the fire rate of the pipe gun, and its improvised nature makes it similarly suited for modification."
Railway Rifle,Small Guns,10,Breaking,Physical,0,"Debilitating, Two-Handed, Unreliable",14,290,M,4,,Railway Spike,"A makeshift weapon created by enterprising engineers in the wastelands, the railway rifle uses high-pressure steam to propel railway spikes at speeds sufficient to pierce and impale a wide range of targets."
Syringer,Small Guns,3,,Physical,0,Two-Handed,6,132,M,2,"Syringer ammunition comes in the many forms, see page 93 for details",Syringer Ammo,"A makeshift weapon using air pressure to propel customized syringes at a target. This inflicts little damage by itself, but the syringes can inflict a wide range of debilitating effects."
Institute Laser,Energy Weapon,3,Burst,Energy,3,"Close Quarters, Inaccurate",4,50,C,2,,Fusion Cells,"Developed by The Institute after the Great War, Institute lasers differ in design and function from the pre-War lasers used by other factions such as the Brotherhood of Steel. Eschewing raw power for a rapid succession of beams, these lasers can lay down a sear ing volley of suppressive fire."
Laser Musket,Energy Weapon,5,Piercing 1,Energy,0,Two-Handed,13,57,M,1,,Fusion Cells,"The laser musket is a homemade form of laser rifle, blending advanced technology with strangely primi tive mechanisms, popular with militia groups such as the Minutemen. The laser musket must be manually primed, charging the makeshift capacitor through turning a hand-crank on the weapon's rear. While seemingly crude, they can make for potent sniper's weapons, especially with a modified capacitor able to hold a larger charge."
Laser Gun,Energy Weapon,4,Piercing 1,Energy,2,Close Quarters,4,69,C,2,,Fusion Cells,"Laser guns are high-tech weapons which emit a con centrated beam of coherent, directional light, intense enough to inflict serious damage. They were a rela tively new development in the years before the Great War, and thus are not an especially common sight in the wasteland, outside of those groups who've secured old military weapons caches. Most surviving models of laser gun-such as the dependable AER9, widely used by the U. S. Army-use an internal capacitor charged by a microfusion power cell."
Plasma Gun,Energy Weapon,6,,Physical/Energy,1,Close Quarters,4,123,C,3,"you inflict both Physical or Energy damage, whichever of the target's damage resistances is lower",Plasma Cartridge,"Plasma guns, or plasma casters, are high-tech weapons firing super heated ionized gas, or plasma. Powered by a plasma cartridge, these weapons are rare and potent, delivering damage through the high-speed impact of the plasma bolt and then thermal transfer as the heat from the plasma bolt is transferred into the target at the moment of impact."
Gamma Gun,Energy Weapon,3,"Piercing 1, Stun",Radiation,1,"Blast, Inaccurate",3,15,M,5,,Gamma Rounds,"A crude-looking weapon, the gamma gun emits directed blasts of high-intensity ionizing radiation which can be devastating to any creature not immune nor massively resistant to radiation, while leaving other targets largely unharmed."
Fat Man,Big Guns,21,"Breaking, Radioactive, Vicious",Physical,0,"Blast, Inaccurate, Two-Handed",31,512,M,4,,Mini-Nuke,"The M42 Nuclear Catapult is a shoulder-fired infan try support weapon which launches compact tactical nuclear warheads-mini-nukes, each about the size of a football-over a moderate distance to inflict massive destruction upon the target location."
Flamer,Big Guns,3,"Burst, Persistent, Spread",Energy,4,"Debilitating, Inaccurate, Two-Handed",16,137,C,3,,Flamer Fuel,"A flamethrower, or flamer, is a weapon which sprays an ignited fuel mixture over an area, essentially cre ating a jet of flame that can burn or ignite targets at a distance. Ideal for clearing dead foliage, irritating vermin, and fortified bunkers!"
Gatling Laser,Big Guns,3,"Burst, Piercing 1",Energy,6,"Gatling, Inaccurate, Two-Handed",19,804,M,3,,"Fusion Cells, Fusion Core","A high rate-of-fire laser weapon, the Gatling laser uses several rotating barrels fired in quick succession to produce a devastating fusillade of laser pulses. While the individual laser pulses lack in stopping power. the sheer mass of them can wear down almost any target. Gatling lasers can operate from any sufficient power source, and while fusion cells can be used to power them, the rate-of-fire means that they are often quickly expended. Most users instead rely on a larger power source, such as a fusion core."
Heavy Incinerator,Big Guns,5,"Burst, Persistent, Spread",Energy,3,"Debilitating, Two-Handed",20,350,M,4,,Flamer Fuel,"Like a flamethrower, a heavy incinerator also propels ignited fuel mixtures to burn a target. However, the heavy incinerator differs in that it appears to lob a succes sion of fireballs at the target, lobbing them in an arc like a grenade launcher. These fireballs burst upon impact, spreading flames as the fuel splashes off the target."
Junk Jet,Big Guns,6,,Physical,1,Two-Handed,30,285,M,3,"When you fire the Junk Jet, choose any item you are currently carrying. Choose one additional item for each additional shot of ammunition. Items must be small enough to be held in one hand. At the end of the scene, you may roll a die for each item fired from the junk jet; on an Effect, that item survived the attack",Anything,"The Junk Jet is a makeshift heavy weapon which fires anything. Any items loaded into the weapon's hopper are hurled with deadly force from the business end of the gun. Naturally, this makes it quite useful in situations where random junk is abundant but actual ammunition is scarce."
Minigun,Big Guns,3,"Burst, Spread",Physical,5,"Gatling, Inaccurate, Two-Handed",27,382,M,2,,5mm,"The minigun is a motorized Gatling-style rapid fire weapon commonly employed by the military, or other lesser factions that managed to acquire such a weapon. Miniguns can be found as mounted door guns on Vertibirds or as a handheld heavy assault and support weapon. The high rate-of-fire of the weapon means that it can produce devastating results, but at a cost of consuming ammo at incredible rates, making it diffi cult to keep the weapon supplied."
Missile Launcher,Big Guns,11,,Physical,0,"Blast, Two-Handed",21,314,L,4,,Missle,"A refined, highly adaptable multipurpose missile weapon introduced into the American arsenal, the modular launcher is smaller and more maneuverable than the earlier model. It consists of the two-part launch tube, firing mechanism, mounting brackets; open battle sights and a mount for a guidance system. It is a breech-loading weapon, reloaded by lifting the front section of the launch tube and sliding the 72mm fin-stabilized missile inside. The rear part of the tube is designed to safely disperse launch gasses, allowing it to be launched from confined spaces. Other forms and designs of Missile Launcher exist across the waste lands, but this form is common enough that most consider it the standard."
Sword,Melee Weapon,4,Piercing 1,Physical,,Parry,3,50,,2,,,"Swords have been in use for almost as long as wars have been fought and remained widespread as symbols of status and prestige amongst soldiers-particularly officers across the world right up until the Great War. Many of the swords found in the wastelands are those used by Chinese officers during the Great War, often taken from battlefields as a trophy by American troops. Others are museum pieces or replicas from private collections, with many resembling the cavalry sabers used during the American Revolution."
Combat Knife,Melee Weapon,3,Piercing 1,Physical,,,1,25,,1,,,"For both fighting and for utility uses, soldiers-and those who seek to emulate soldiers-frequently carry knives. The Combat Knife found across the wastelands is normally of the same type as was issued to U.S. Army soldiers during the Great War, a single-edged blade with a clipped point. The weapon is lightweight and sturdy, and intended for heavy use."
Machete,Melee Weapon,3,Piercing 1,Physical,,,2,25,,1,,,"A long, sharp knife designed to hack through dense or tough vegetation, the same properties that make it a useful tool also make it an effective weapon. While some machetes found in the wasteland were pur pose-made blades, others are makeshift tools, typi cally made from a sharpened metal blade such as that salvaged from a lawnmower, bolted, tied, taped, or otherwise affixed to a simple handle."
Ripper,Melee Weapon,4,Vicious,Physical,,,6,50,,2,,,"The Ripper is a small, handheld, militaris chainsaw that saw extensive use in the armed conflicts before the Great War, with a commercial-grade, scaled-down version made available for the general market. It can saw through both flesh and metal alike with ease."
Shishkebab,Melee Weapon,5,Piercing 1,Energy,,Parry,3,200,,3,,,"A makeshift ""flaming sword"", the Shishkebab is found in various forms across the wastelands, with some versions being built around actual swords, while others are constructed from a variety of components. They all have a few common elements, however: some form of fuel tank or canister (either affixed to the weapon itself, or worn by the wielder and connected by a hose), a pilot light, and a triggering mechanism"
Switchblade,Melee Weapon,2,Piercing 1,Physical,,Concealed,1,20,,0,,,"The switchblade is a commonly found melee weapon. Its small size means that it is easily smuggled into restricted areas and is easy to handle. It doesn't do as damage as larger knives or blades, however."
Baseball Bat,Melee Weapon,4,,Physical,,Two-Handed,3,25,,1,,,"Baseball bats were once used in the sport of baseball, considered America's number-one pastime during the pre-War era. Two hundred years later, they have been re-purposed as crude but effective melee weapons. While most are made a single piece of wood-normally ash, but other hardwoods are often used a few can be found made of aluminum instead, making for a lighter, harder bat."
Aluminum Baseball Bat,Melee Weapon,5,,Physical,,Two-Handed,2,32,,2,,,"Baseball bats were once used in the sport of baseball, considered America's number-one pastime during the pre-War era. Two hundred years later, they have been re-purposed as crude but effective melee weapons. While most are made a single piece of wood-normally ash, but other hardwoods are often used a few can be found made of aluminum instead, making for a lighter, harder bat."
Board,Melee Weapon,4,,Physical,,Two-Handed,3,20,,0,,,"Little more than a long plank of wood with a handle wrapped in duct tape. Boards are heavy melee weap ons, normally favored by super mutants who have the strength to wield them effectively."
Lead Pipe,Melee Weapon,3,,Physical,,,3,15,,0,,,"A length of heavy, metal (normally lead) pipe, with a duct-tape wrapped grip at one end and a few nuts and bolts attached at the other. Crude, simple, and hurts like hell."

Baton,Melee Weapon,3,,Physical,,,2,15,,1,,,"A collapsible baton of the sort used by police depart ments and private security forces before the Great War. Vault-Tec security within each vault had a stock of these, so they remain in common use as a light weight back-up melee weapon."
Sledgehammer,Melee Weapon,5,,Physical,,,12,40,,2,,,"Sledgehammers are primitive weapons, used as tools before the Great War, for breaking ground or demol ishing things. Although not usually considered as a powerful weapon, a strong person-or a super mutant-can wield one of these like a club, taking full advantage of the hammer's weight."
Super Sledge,Melee Weapon,6,Breaking,Physical,,Two-Handed,20,180,,3,,,"Super Sledgehammers are powered variants of the regular sledgehammer. Older, pre-War designs were outfitted with kinetic storage devices to increase the impact force, while post-War ones mount a small rocket motor within the hammer's head to accelerate the swing and deliver a heavier blow."
Tire Iron,Melee Weapon,3,,Physical,,,2,25,,1,,,A simple L-shaped tool found commonly in cars and garages; tire irons make for handy weapons when not being used to change the tires on a car.
Walking Cane,Melee Weapon,3,,Physical,,,2,10,,0,,,"A simple stick used to support those who can't walk so well, a walking cane is sturdy enough to be an impromptu weapon if you've not got any other options."
Boxing Glove,Unarmed,3,Stun,Physical,,,1,10,,1,,,"A large, leather mitt, used to protect the hands and wrists while punching. While originally used during sporting matches, a skilled fighter can use these to deliver solid blows to enemies in less organized fights, particularly if they've modified the glove in some way."
Deathclaw Gauntlet,Unarmed,5,Piercing 1,Physical,,,10,75,,3,,,"Made from the severed fingers and talons of a death claw and mounted on a cuff which fits over the wrist, these allow the wearer to strike with some of the lethal force of the claws' previous owner."
Knuckles,Unarmed,3,,Physical,,Concealed,<1,10,,1,,,"Developed in antiquity, this weapon is nevertheless quite prevalent in the post-Great War wastelands. Brass Knuckles, or Knuckledusters, take the form of four linked metal rings in a shallow convex forma tion with a bumper attached to the concave face.

Tomahawk,Throwing,4,Piercing 1,Physical,,"Supressed, Thrown",<1,15,C,2,,,"A small, short-handled axe, akin to a small hatchet. Less subtle than a throwing knife, a hurled tomahawk can certainly make an impression in an enemy."
Javelin,Throwing,4,Piercing 1,Physical,,"Supressed, Thrown",4,10,M,1,,,"A short spear, not typically sturdy enough for close-in fighting, a javelin can be thrown a considerable distance."
Baseball Grenade,Explosive,5,,Physical,,"Blast, Thrown",1,40,M,1,,,"Little more than a hollowed-out baseball filled with an improvised explosive mixture, these grenades are crude, low-tech, and easy to make, dealing a moderate amount of damage to those within the blast."
Frag Grenade,Explosive,6,,Physical,,"Blast, Thrown",<1,50,M,2,,,"A basic fragmentation grenade, consisting of an explo sive core within a metal casing designed to shatter into shrapnel upon detonation. They're simple and highly effective. Just remember to throw the grenade, and not the pin."
Molotov Cocktail,Explosive,4,"Persistent, Breaker",Energy,,"Blast, Thrown",1,20,M,1,,,"Consisting of a glass bottle-normally from an alcoholic beverage containing a flammable fuel mixture, a bit of motor oil to help it spread, and an alcohol-soaked rag stuffed in the top to act as a wick. When used, the wick is ignited and the bottle hurled at the target; the breaking bottle spreads the agitated mixture, which quickly ignites begins to burn any thing in the vicinity. Cheap and effective."
Nuka Grenade,Explosive,9,"Radioactive, Vicious",Energy,,"Blast, Thrown",1,100,M,4,,,"A tiny, handheld tactical nuclear weapon, a Nuka grenade is extremely dangerous to use-dropping one is ill-advised-but devastatingly effective, comparable to the mini-nukes used by the Fat Man launcher."

Bottlecap Mine,Explosive,6,,Physical,,"Blast, Mine",1,75,,2,"when constructing a Bottlecap mine, you may add extra bottlecaps; every 10 caps added increases the damage by +1. When the mine detonates, roll the damage rating a second time: the total is the number of surviving caps",,"The Bottlecap mine is crudely put together, yet a formidable explosive. Bottlecap mines are constructed from a simple container such as a lunchbox, filled with bottle caps and a crude explosive mixture, and fitted with a sensor and a detonator. The explosive force hurls the caps over a wide area at such speed that they are essentially shrapnel."
Frag Mine,Explosive,6,,Physical,,"Blast, Mine",1,50,,2,,,"Similar in design and construction to a frag grenade, a fragmentation mine is instead placed on the ground and uses a pressure plate or proximity sensor to trig ger detonation when someone gets too close."
Nuke Mine,Explosive,9,"Breaker, Radioactive, Vicious",Energy,,"Blast, Thrown",1,100,M,4,,,"It is a nuclear variant of a landmine. The Nuke mine operates in all respects as other mines do although its explosion is more akin to that of a mini-nuke. Naturally, this means that they inflict damage from both the explosion and from the radi ation the blast emits."
Plasma Mine,Explosive,9,,Energy,,"Blast, Thrown",<1,135,M,3,"you inflict both Physical or Energy damage, whichever of the target's damage resistances is lower",,"These magnetically sealed mines unleash a blast of energized plasma upon being triggered, searing those who tripped the mine's sensors."
